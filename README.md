## Special items & events

**Mech-Fall Transmitter**: This is the orbital targetter needed to spawn the M7 Mech. It can be obtained from item stash quests and traders, similar to the way other orbital weapons are gained.

**The Fractal Enhancement**: A special pill developed by ancient archotech societies, when consumed by an android it will increase almost every useful stat per each use. However if a human consumes it they will convert into a fractal mutant.

**Android Assembly Kits**: These kits are useful for setting up colonies as they are only a fraction the weight of the android they can be assembled into, able to set up wherever and whenever.

**Swarm Mortar**: A Mortar filled with several small drones that will attack any hostiles on sight, can be made once T2 Android research is done.

**Mechanite Storage Upgrades**: Each tier of Mechanite storage upgrade increases or decreases health regen speed, with an archotech mechanite storage upgrade halving the time it takes an android to recover from injuries.

**SkyCloud**: Allow to digitize and store your colonists minds in supercomputers, from which you can control your entire colony.

**M8 Mech Unit**: A limited mobile SkyCloud Core also equipped with a Skymind radio, allowing to store 10 minds and provide 3 SkyMind slots wherever the mech is

![M.U.F.F Unit](https://i.imgur.com/MgDITNZ.png)<br/>
Summary: a very strong robotic hauler that is very useful for caravan trips but not very useful for anything else.

**Phytomining Unit**<br/>
![Phytomining Unit](https://i.imgur.com/79YK5Ji.png)<br/>
Summary: Named after the process that this machine performs; extracting the small amounts of metal absorbed by plants, refining it and expelling it in the form of long, spindly strands on it's back and neck.
This faux wool can then be used to make resistant clothing or be refined into steel at an electric smelter.

**N.Solution Unit**<br/>
![N.Solution Unit](https://i.imgur.com/bD4hyrK.png)<br/>
Summary: produces nutrient solution, a form of artifical milk that holds twice as much nutrition as it's counterpart; actual milk.

**Chemical processing unit**<br/>
![N.Solution Unit](https://i.imgur.com/mugMPOk.png)<br/>
Summary: every 2 days will dispense up to 5 capsules at once, these capsules contain semi-refined resources within them that can either be further developed into chemfuel or neutroamine at a drug lab or refinery.
