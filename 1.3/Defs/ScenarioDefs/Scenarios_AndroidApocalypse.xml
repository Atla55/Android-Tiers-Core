However, with all good things coming to an end, the machines designed to serve humanity has rebelled, apparently led by a new advanced model of T4 ... The confrontation was extremely brutal. They have decimated almost all of the billions of human settlers on all of the inhabited worlds. The only survivor of this genocide, a damaged M8 unit hosting the spirits of 3 digitized human, and a basic security software bot of class CERBERUS, managed to escape aboard a surrogate transport freighter and landed on an abandoned Rimworld under the radars, with the aim of trying to make what remains of humanity survive ...</description>
