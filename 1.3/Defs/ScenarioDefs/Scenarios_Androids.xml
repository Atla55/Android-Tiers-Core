		<description>You were taken to this rimworld through cargo ship, set on a course for a nearby star system that had planned to scrap your bodies for advanced components. However that obviously didn't turn out as planned, you had overheard the employee of the freighter cancel their payments; as such the pilot decided to dump you onto this rimworld instead, probably a better fate than what had awaited you anyway. </description>

					<text>Lined up amongst a series of hundreds of other androids, you all wonder what will happen when you arrive at your destination. This thought is interrupted however by the bay doors below you opening, releasing all androids onto the planet below in cramped ejection pods. You can hear the sound of the pod breaking through the atmosphere at breakneck speeds, unable to slow down in anyway possible until you slam down onto the surface. You find that only 3 androids made it out unharmed around you, the others reduced to scrap upon impact.</text>
